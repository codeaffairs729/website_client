We also created a logbook within the mobile app (client side) that compiles images, videos, and metadata information. Client-side compilation is vital due to the lack of cellular network availability underwater. Upon the diver's return and subsequent reconnection of the app to the internet, a seamless mechanism automatically synchronizes the data with the cloud.",
