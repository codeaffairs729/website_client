        'This case study focuses on a mobile application specially designed to record underwater diving adventures. Through this app, users can effortlessly capture underwater photos and create videos. This application ensures safety by offering details about pressure, temperature, and other factors under water. The appâ€™s safety alerts will notify you if you have reached your depth stop, or ascending too fast. In the case of an emergency, the app will let you know what to do at the current depth to stay safe. It also supports free diving mode with features including, a stopwatch for static apnea, and boat calling. This application functions without any phone signal and displays information, such as dive duration, and no-decompression limit (NDL) to prevent accidents and decompression sickness',
