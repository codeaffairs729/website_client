            So, What's The Difference Between a Progressive Web App (PWA) and a
            Web App
          </h2>
          <p className="hire-p">
            Before exploring the cost estimation, it is pivotal to understand
            how progressive web apps differ from conventional web apps. <br />
            <br />
            Well, PWA is a kind of regular web app but has more potential. It is
            a combination of both the web and application that offers magnified
            user experience on desktop as well as on mobile. <br />
            <br />
            Users can seamlessly install as well as launch PWAs on their devices
            same as other native applications. These applications demand
            browsers and connectivity to work smoothly regardless of the nature
            of device and operating system. Progressive Web Apps give a swift,
            more enhanced and convenient user experience as compared to web
            applications.

          </p>

          <h2 className="hire-h2">Why Build a Progressive Web App</h2>
          <h3 className="hire-h3">Works Offline</h3>
          <p className="hire-p">
            One of the major drawbacks of standard web applications is that the
            user has to be online to use them. However, Progressive Web App
            (PWA) can work in online as well offline mode, meaning the user
            experience will not be influenced by an instant internet
            connectivity drop.
          </p>
          <h3 className="hire-h3">It Behaves like a Native App</h3>
          <p className="hire-p">
            Most of the users prefer native applications over web applications,
            due to the convenience and personal preferences it offers.
            Progressive Web App (PWA) looks as well as behaves like a mobile
            app, including the home screen and more advanced features.
          </p>
          <h3 className="hire-h3">Direct Downloading</h3>
          <p className="hire-p">
            The best thing about Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) is that they can be
            downloaded straight from your website. So, there is no need to
            search for your application on 3rd party app stores. This will help
            in ameliorating the user experience and also stops you from losing
            deals as well as potential clients.
          </p>
          <h3 className="hire-h3">Improved Performance</h3>
          <p className="hire-p">
            Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) offer enhanced performance when compared
            to conventional applications. This ameliorates user experience and
            also decreases the likelihood of user abandonment.
          </p>
          <h3 className="hire-h3">Light Weight</h3>
          <p className="hire-p">
            Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are 80 – 90% lighter than traditional
            apps. Just look at Twitter lite (PWA), it's only 1.5MB and the
            Twitter native application is more than 110MB in size.
          </p>
          <h3 className="hire-h3">Automatic Updates</h3>
          <p className="hire-p">
            PWAs are reliable for automatic updates without disturbing your
            users in between sessions. Additionally, you can simply send your
            users push notifications to let them know about upgrades.
          </p>
          <h3 className="hire-h3">Cheaper To Build</h3>
          <p className="hire-p">
            Due to reduced development and maintenance costs, PWA stores are
            less expensive to build. Furthermore, you are not required to create
            a separate native app.

          <div className="text-center p-4">
            {/* <Image

          <h3 className="hire-h3">Specific Requirements</h3>
          <p className="hire-p">
            The price to build a progressive web app relies on the type of the
            business as well the expected result of business owners. The thing
            is the cost to develop a PWA for an online booking system will be
            different from the cost of developing a PWA for food or retail
            stores as every app demands distinctive resources.
          </p>
          <h3 className="hire-h3">UI & UX Requirements</h3>
          <p className="hire-p">
            UI & UX plays a cardinal role in the development cost as they both
            are pivotal in making your application stand out from the
            competition. Top-quality graphics are important but they raise the
            cost of development PWA. It depends solely on business owners how
            much they want to spend.
          </p>
          <h3 className="hire-h3">Tech Stack</h3>
          <p className="hire-p">
            The CMS, custom coding, elements, SEO, prototype on each page,
            number of page cache, navigation etcetera will influence the overall
            cost of building PWA. Simply put, the more futuristic the tech stack
            is, the more it will cost.
          </p>
          <h3 className="hire-h3">Developer’s Expertise and Location</h3>
          <p className="hire-p">
            The hourly rate for developing the app depends upon region to region
            and also if we talk about developers the expert rate will also be
            more. To exemplify, if you hire an experienced developer from US,
            the cost will be more (average rate/hour $70–150) while if the
            developer is from India he/she will charge you around (average
            rate/hour: $30–50)
