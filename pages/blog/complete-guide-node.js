          <h2 className="hire-h2">What Is Node.js? </h2>
          <p className="hire-p">
            Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source environment and also a
            library of Chrome’s Javascript, generally applied for creating and
            running scalable and adaptable web applications. Node.js is
            developed on Google Chrome’s JavaScript Engine V8, which utilizes a
            non-blocking I/O model that is more productive, lightweight, a
            perfect choice for data-intensive real-time applications running
            across various shared devices. <br />
            <br />
            Put differently, node.js is not a framework, library, or programming
            language, used for conventional application software. It is an
            environment! <br />
            <br />
            In today’s world, the node.js environment is eminent not only
            because of the right place and the right time, it was developed in
            2009 by Ryan Dahl. Instead, it is designed with real-time push-based
            architectures in mind, and features a great significant scope of
            creative approaches for JavaScript server-side development.
            <br />
            <br />
            These days, Node.js is now frequently used to create both front-end
            and back-end API services, encompassing:

          <h2 className="hire-h2">Features of Node.js</h2>

          <p className="hire-p">
            Once you get to the basis of Node.js, it’s the right time to explore
            its potential by looking at the key features. Reviewing its features
            will help you gain insight about using Node.js, and also let you
            know whether or not it’s the accurate option you require for your
            software development projects.
            <br />
            <br />
            Some of the key functions of Node.js one should know about are:
          </p>
          <h3 className="hire-h3">Microservices </h3>
          <p className="hire-p">
            It is an individual, and self-contained unit that works adjacent
            with others to make up a substantial application. Microservices
            allow distinctive application components to be managed and
            compartmentalized individually, updated and modified with affecting
            the performance of an application.
          </p>
          <h3 className="hire-h3">Event-driven Programming </h3>
          <p className="hire-p">
            It is a feature that allows acquiring a swift response to different
            forms of user engagement, including key presses or clicks. This
            feature is solely designed to detect the actions as they happen to
            ameliorate the UX and boost the flexibility of the application.{' '}

          <h3 className="hire-h3">Easily Scalable </h3>
          <p className="hire-p">
            Initially, the applications based on Node.js are scalable, both
            horizontally and vertically. Horizontal scaling enables adding new
            nodes swiftly while vertical scaling allows adding resources to the
            present nodes, which can significantly speed up the development
            procedure. In addition, the Node.js application can ideally work
            with a group of modules and microservices, which makes the
            development procedure more easy and simple - an ideal choice for
            scalable startups.
          </p>

          <h3 className="hire-h3">Large Community Support </h3>
          <p className="hire-p">
            The Node.js Foundation was founded in 2015 and consists of
            preeminent enterprises like Microsoft, SAP, Fidelity, and IBM . This
            implies that you'll always be able to develop as well as maintain
            any framework and obtain support among semi-minders.
          </p>

          <h3 className="hire-h3">First-Class Performance </h3>
          <p className="hire-p">
            Node.js is renowned as the feature-rich, powerful environment for
            creating scalable and ultra fast performing applications. With
            non-blocking I/O tasks and event-driven architecture that can
            conveniently run on a single thread without any delays and blocking
            of any operations. These attributes make Node.js an efficient tool
            that can significantly expedite the speed of framework.
          </p>

          <h3 className="hire-h3">Advanced Development Speed </h3>
          <p className="hire-p">
            One of the reliable features of Node.js is its ability to quicken
            the web application development procedure with a diversity of tools
            that are easy to use and lightweight. The Node Package Management
            (NPM) registry offers a range of modules, solutions, and libraries
            that enable the development of valuable applications at a lesser
            cost and effort. Moreover, the node.js environment helps to
            considerably mitigate the bugs, decrease the size of the app, and
            develop the application in short duration with reusable templates.
          </p>

          <h3 className="hire-h3">More Flexible </h3>
