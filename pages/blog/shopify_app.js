            Are you wondering what headless shopify actually is?
            <br />
            Well, you first need to understand Shopify.
            <br />
            So, let’s dig in! <br />
            Shopify is a multinational Canadian commerce company that was
            founded in the year 2004. Since then, the popularity of the brand
            has grown significantly. Moreover, Shopify currently offers services
            that provide support to over one million businesses in 172
            countries. Overall, these businesses now make over 200 billion US
            dollars in sales. <br />
            Shopify provides a sole platform that allows users to sell their
            products and services all over the globe, both online through their
            website and in person via its point-of-sale (POS) feature. The
            feature set of Shopify covers all factors of sales, including
            shipping, managing orders, and payment. Furthermore, Shopify also
            offers tools for the analysis, execution, and creation of digital
            marketing campaigns.
            <br />
            Shopify also has a decoupled headless framework and in this article,
            we will give you an explanation of headless Shopify, and how to set
            it up:
            <br />
            Let’s explore!

          <h2 className="hire-h2">What Headless Shopify Is?</h2>
          <p className="hire-p">
            Headless Shopify is a plus feature of Shopify that enables users to
            shift from the conventional “full-stack” approach of Shopify’s
            conventional architecture to a format that has a front-end design
            secluded from the back-end functionality.
            <br />
            The headless framework allows your Shopify storefront to be
            published to and from approximately any platform at a considerably
            higher pace. Moreover, it offers a high level of flexibility as
            businesses can utilize any device to handle the checkout procedure
            and also employ any CMS (Content Management System)
            <br />
            The cardinal part of Shopify’s headless framework is Shopify
            Storefront API. It provides businesses functionality and creative
            control to offer numerous buying experiences no matter the location
            of the customer. Moreover, brands can utilize their own client and
            can opt for libraries that are included in the Storefront API which
            is “Buy software development kits (SDKs).” These software
            development kits add commerce features to websites, games, and
            applications. A noteworthy example is - JavaScript Buy SDK. It is a
            lightweight library that is based on Shopify’s API. Moreover, it
            allows websites to fetch information about services or products from
            the store, add products or services to the cart, checkout, and much
            more. <br />
            Plus, headless commerce works in both online and offline modes. The
            first online feature (PWAs) is progressive web apps, which use
            progressive rendering for websites and pre-caching, leading to swift
            load times as well as multi-device compatibility. Second is the
            custom native mobile applications that are for online experiences.{' '}
            <br />
            On the other hand, offline features include live streaming, voice
            shopping, vending machines, smart mirrors, and video games.
