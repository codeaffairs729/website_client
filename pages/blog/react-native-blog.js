          <h2 className="hire-h2">What React Native Is?</h2>
          <p className="hire-p">
            React Native also known as RN, a renowned JavaScript based mobile
            application framework that enables you to build natively-rendered
            mobile applications for Android and iOS. With the help of React
            Native framework you can create an app for distinctive platforms by
            utilizing the same codebase. <br />
            <br />
            React Native was initially released by Meta (earlier known as
            Facebook) as an open-source project in the year 2015. In just
            several years, it became one of the reliable solutions used for
            mobile development. Some of the world’s preeminent mobile
            applications, including Skype, Instagram, Meta (Facebook) are
            powered by React Native development.
          </p>
          <ul className="hire-list">
            <h3 className="hire-h3">
              There are numerous reasons behind the global success of React
              Native:
            </h3>
            <li>
              <p className="hire-p">
                Firstly, with the help of React Native, you can create a code
                just once and then use it for both Android and iOS apps. This
                can contribute to saving resources and time as well.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p className="hire-p">
                Secondly, React Native was developed on React - a JavaScript
                library, which was already very famous when it was released.{' '}
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p className="hire-p">
                Thirdly, React Native empowers the front-end developers, who
                only work with web-based innovations priorly and with the help
                of this framework now they can create robust and
                production-ready applications for mobile platforms.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2 className="hire-h2">React Vs React Native</h2>
          <div className="text-center p-4">
            <Image
              src="/blog_images/react-vs-react-native.webp"
              width={1060}
              height={530}
            />
          </div>
          <p className="hire-p">
            To simply put, React Native is not a new version of React, even
            though React Native does use it. <br /> <br />
            React (also called ReactJS) -a JavaScript Library utilized for
            developing the website’s frontend. Likewise to React Native, it was
            also created by the Meta (Facebook) engineering team. <br /> <br />
            React Native, which is run by React, enables developers to utilize
            UI components to swiftly assemble and launch Android and iOS
            applications. <br /> <br />
            Both React Native and React utilize a blend of JavaScript and a
            unique markup language- JSX. Nevertheless, the syntax utilized to
            render components in JSX elements differ between React Native and
            React. Moreover, React utilizes some CSS and HTML, while React
            Native enables the use of native mobile user interface components.{' '}

          <h2 className="hire-h2">What Cross-Platform Development Is?</h2>
          <p className="hire-p">
            Cross-platform development is a procedure of developing software
            that is compatible with more than one type of hardware platform. It
            can run on Windows, Microsoft, macOS, and Linux, or just two of
            them. To exemplify, a cross-platform app is a Adobe Flash or web
            browser that works the same way on any computer or mobile device.
          </p>
          <h3 className="hire-h3">
            Characteristics of cross-platform development:{' '}
          </h3>
          <h3 className="hire-h3">Platform Consistency</h3>
          <p className="hire-p">
            In cross-platform development, there are a few design and navigation
            differences between Android and iOS that are automatically addressed
            due to shared codebase. This aids with developing a constant
            application brand identity across both platforms with less efforts
            than if created on native.
          </p>

          <h3 className="hire-h3">Reusable Code </h3>
          <p className="hire-p">
            Building one codebase for both iOS and Android at the same time is
            one of the significant benefits of cross-platform development.
            Native application development needs writing code individually and
            frequently requires two distinctive softwares to work on- one for
            Android, and other for iOS.
          </p>

          <h3 className="hire-h3">Swift Development </h3>
          <p className="hire-p">
            As you know that only one codebase is needed to handle Android and
            iOS, and everything is positioned in one place, the product
            development is swift. Cross-platform apps are developed as single
            projects, although they support distinctive devices, and a
            significant amount of coder that can be reused between platforms.
          </p>

          <h3 className="hire-h3">Wider Audience</h3>
          <p className="hire-p">
            In cross-platform development there is no need to decide about the
            audience to target, i.e., Android or iOS users as the software runs
            on both , which offers access to a wider user base.
          </p>

          <h3 className="hire-h3">Reduced Costs </h3>
          <p className="hire-p">
            Developing cross-platform apps can be 30 to 35% cheaper than
            developing native applications, all because of its ability to reuse
            code and swift development, which impacts the cost.
          </p>

          <h2 className="hire-h2">How Does React Native Work? </h2>
          <p className="hire-p">
            React Native is written with a combination of JXL and JavaScript, a
            unique markup code that resembles XML. This framework has the power
            to communicate with both- native app threads, JavaScript-based
            threads as well as existent.
            <br />
            <br />
            So, how does this communication work? React Native works as a
            so-called “bridge”. While Native and JavaScript threads are
            completely written in distinctive languages, it is the bridge
            feature that makes the bidirectional communication possible.
          </p>

          <ul className="hire-list">
            <p className="hire-p">
              Let’s explore the benefits of React Native:
            </p>
            <li>
              <h3 className="hire-h3">Code Reusability</h3>
              <p className="hire-p">
                Reuse of code is the biggest benefit of React Native and it also
                shows that applications can run effectively on numerous
                platforms. <br />
                <br />
                Another advantage of React Native is that you can use the web
                application code for mobile app development . Moreover, it also
                fastens the development process as it contains pre-developed
                components, which are included in the open-source library.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 className="hire-h3">Cost Efficiency</h3>
              <p className="hire-p">
                React Native Development is cost efficient because the
                developers can use the same code to develop apps for Android and
                iOS.
                <br />
                <br />
                This means that you don't need to hire two devs for iOS and
                Android for your project. The cost of creating applications is
                much lower than applications developed using languages that do
                not allow for cross-platform development.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 className="hire-h3">Swift Refresh</h3>
              <p className="hire-p">
                Swift refresh enables developers to run the application while
                modifying the UI and also updating it to the latest versions.
                The modifications are visible immediately, and the devs are
                spared for redeveloping the whole application.{' '}

            <li>
              <h3 className="hire-h3">Simple UI</h3>
              <p className="hire-p">
                React Native development utilizes React JavaScript to develop
                the interface of the app which makes it faster and more
                responsive, resulting in better user experience. The framework
                is ideal for developing applications with simple as well as
                complex designs due to the component-based approach and reactive
                UI.{' '}
